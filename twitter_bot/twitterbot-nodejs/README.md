Yeah it pretty much does what it says in the title. Its a twitter bot which can post tweets, retweet other tweets and possibly fav tweets.

This is a simple bot , to build which I had to go through a lot of information on the internet possibly because it wasn't updated/consistent. Plus I wanted to learn how build a bot anyhow ;)

Currently active bot using the same code is [GDGND Bot](https://twitter.com/gdgndbot).
Hopefully it helps some other people who want to build their own bot.

Simple.Easy.Cute (Ok, last one didnot go with the flow..) 

> It attempts to retweet once per hour


## Installation

+ Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
+ Clone this repo
 
	```bash
	  git clone https://github.com/nisrulz/twitterbot-nodejs.git
	```
+ Run 
	```bash
	npm install
	```

	> It will install [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit), the library that lets us talk to Twitter.

## Connecting to Twitter

1. Register a Twitter account and also get its "app info".
	>Twitter doesn't allow you to register multiple twitter accounts on the same email address. I recommend you create a brand new email address (perhaps using Gmail) for the Twitter account. Once you register the account to that email address, wait for the confirmation email.

1. Now go [here](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new) and log in as the Twitter account for your bot:
1. Fill up the form and submit.
1. Next once the submission completes you will be taken to a page which has the 
	+ "Settings" tab : Update details here
	+ "Permissons" tab :  Enable `Read and Write` 
	+ "Key and Access Token" tab : Click on `Create my access token`. 
1. Use the generated tokens in the "Key and Access Token" tab to fill the fields under the `config.js` file in your app directory.
	It should look like this:

	```javascript
	module.exports = {
	  consumer_key:         'blah',
	  consumer_secret:      'blah',
	  access_token:         'blah',
	  access_token_secret:  'blah'
	}
	```
1. Update the code under `bot.js` , with the your values. Best of all modify the code, tinker with it.
1. Now type the following in the command line in your project directory:

	```bash
	node bot.js
	```

Hopefully at this point you see a message like "Success! Check your bot, it should have retweeted something." 
Ok it won't say that, you have to code that in. Its simple as 

```javascript
console.log("Success! Check your bot, it should have retweeted something.");
```

Check the Twitter account for your bot, and it should have retweeted a tweet with the provided hashtag.


### **Whats Next**

You might want to push this app to a running server , probably [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

> Note : Heroku servers would go back to sleep if there is no activity after some time, so you can have a look at [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) , to keep your server active.
>
> Do not misuse the twitter api to spam or burden the server load for twitter api , as twitter follows a strict rule of closing down accounts that do that. Please read [here for the rules](https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311)
